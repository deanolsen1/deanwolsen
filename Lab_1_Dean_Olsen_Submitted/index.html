            <div id="protext">The period of 2000 through 2011 (the latest available data) saw one of the first-ever declines in total aircraft movements in and out of America’s major airports. The data is compiled by the Airports Council International, an international trade organization. The data, supplied by ACI’s member airports, counts all aircraft movements, including passenger flights, air freight travel, mail planes, and other cargo flights. (The data does not include military aircraft movements.)
            <p>Proportional symbols are good for showing the relative activity of aircraft departures and arrivals for a particular year at these large, American airports. From the map, it is clear that Chicago and Atlanta are large airports with many aircraft arrivals and departures and that New York’s three airports all have about the same volumes. So for any given year, the user can understand the relative activity at the airports.</p>
            <p>However, proportional symbols are not as good at showing change over time at individual airports. The reasons for this are two-fold: people are not adept at accurately estimating differences in volumes and people do not recall volumes well to aid in comparing two time states. But proportional symbols also do not and, in fact, cannot, show the importance of change in any given map subject. For example, JFK in New York experienced a 16% drop in aircraft arrivals and departments between 2001 and 2002, a major decline which prompted much concern among aviation officials. But on the proportional symbol map, this major decline looks rather innocuous.</p>

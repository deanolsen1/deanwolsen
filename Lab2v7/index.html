  <h3>Definitions</h3>

<dt><a href="">Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)</a></dt>
<dd>Similiar to American census block groups, LSOAs are the smallest geographical areas in England and Wales from which population and a wide range of other datasets are collected. There are approximately 33,000 LSOAs in England and Wales with an average population size of 1,600.</dd>

<dt><a href="">General Interpretation of Scores</a></dt>
<dd>The higher the score on any index, the more deprivation in a particular LSOA. Scores may be compared between LSOAs on the same index as an indicator or more or less of the deprivation the index measures. However, the scores are not  ratio data: a score of 60 does not indicate twice as much deprivation as a score of 30.</dd>

<dt><a href="">IMD or Index of Multiple Deprivations</a></dt>
<dd>This index combines all the other indices, counts, and indicators. It is used as an overall measure of deprivation. It cannot be interpreted in the reverse. That is, a low deprivation score does not necessarily  mean prosperity or wealth. There are lower-income LSOAs that score low on the IMD.</dd>

<dt><a href="">Income Deprivation Index</a></dt>
<dd>This domain measures the proportion of the population in an LSOA that live in income deprived families. This measure is multiplied by 100 to read as percent figure so an index score of 32 is read as “32% of the population in this LSOA live in income deprived families.” This index includes adults and children in the following categories:  income supported families, Jobseeker’s Allowance families, Pension Credit families, Child Tax Credit families, and subsidence support for asylum seekers.</dd>

<dt><a href="">Employment Deprivation Index</a></dt>
<dd>This domain measures employment deprivation conceptualized as involuntary exclusion of the working age population from the world of work. The employment deprived are defined as those who would like to work but are unable to do so through unemployment, sickness or disability. This index counts individual claimants in the following programs: Jobseeker’s Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, and New Deal. This number is then divided by the working age population of the LSOA.</dd>

<dt><a href="">Education, Skills and Training Deprivation Index</a></dt>
<dd>This domain is designed to reflect the ‘flow’ and ‘stock’ of educational disadvantage within an area respectively. That is, the ‘children and young people’ sub-domain measures the attainment of qualifications and associated measures (‘flow’), while the ‘skills’ sub-domain measures the lack of qualifications in the resident working age adult population (‘stock’).</dd>

<dt><a href="">Housing &amp; Services Deprivation Index</a></dt>
<dd>This domain measures the physical and financial accessibility of housing and key local services. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: ‘geographical barriers’, which relate to the physical proximity of local services, and ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability.</dd>

<dt><a href="">Environment Deprivation Index</a></dt>
<dd>This domain measures the quality of individuals’ immediate surroundings both within and outside the home. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: the ‘indoors’ living environment, which measures the quality of housing, and the ‘outdoors’ living environment which contains two measures relating to air quality and road traffic accidents.</dd>

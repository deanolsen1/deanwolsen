<!--Good works page for Dean Olsen.  I felt it was important to highlight some of the good things I do, including the
alcohol-related stuff. If a firm has a problem with it, they will surely have a problem with me. My work life has a
big gap in it because of my problems with alcohol. If people don't know this, my professional life's ups and big, big
down make no sense. Better to try and position it as a huge positive, which it has turned out to be!-->

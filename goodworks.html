<!--Good works page for Dean Olsen.  I felt it was important to highlight some of the good things I do, including the
alcohol-related stuff. If a firm has a problem with it, they will surely have a problem with me. My work life has a
big gap in it because of my problems with alcohol. If people don't know this, my professional life's ups and big, big
down make no sense. Better to try and position it as a huge positive, which it has turned out to be!-->

I work with men one-on-one to provide a safe place for them to discuss their feelings, not an easy task for older, Lutheran men. My involvement has included over 100 hours of training, twice-monthly supervision sessions, and weekly meetings with care receivers. My involvement with helping people come</p>

The power of understanding and then sharing my own history and hearing the life histories of others is one of the core concepts of my startup, LifeMapping. I'd like my legacy to be bringing this transformative  practice to as wide an audience as I can.</p>

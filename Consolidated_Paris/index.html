	<h1>Movement and Ambiance in Thomas&nbsp;Clerc’s <br>
	  <em class="title">Paris, musée du XXIe&nbsp;siècle, <br>
	    le dixième arrondissement:</em><br>Interactive Maps</h1>

		<p>Thomas Clerc&rsquo;s <em>Paris,  musée du XXIe siècle, le dixième arrondissement (Paris, Museum of the 21st  Century, the Tenth Arrondissement</em>), published by Gallimard in 2007, is a literary work derived from constraint-driven field work carried out by its author. Clerc decided to walk every street, boulevard, square, and other public space of the Tenth Arrondissement of Paris (where he lives), documenting  everything he saw along the way. He carried out the work from 2004 to 2007. Clerc produced a stream of consciousness narrative voice which gives the  impression that the reader is experiencing everything in real time. Whereas the author had to take many breaks and who knows how many stops along the way that  were not documented, the text presents a continuous stream, almost a recording, and the narrator never loses momentum, as though he never actually stopped  walking.<br><br>

		Clerc&rsquo;s text is organized according to what he calls  &ldquo;markers&rdquo; (<em>bornes</em>). This happens essentially in two ways. First, there are geographical markers: the names of the 142 streets, boulevards, squares, and other public spaces he walks and the  building numbers as he passes them are diligently and prominently provided, so that the reader always knows exactly where the narrator is. Second, Clerc  applies to each geographical a much more <em>subjective</em> marker: Clerc classifies everything he records into one of 62 categories of  experience: anything from &ldquo;Ambiance&rdquo; to &ldquo;To Be Blown Up&rdquo; to &ldquo;Synesthesia.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p class="emphasis">The geolocated nature of Clerc&rsquo;s text suggests  the possibility of a mapped reading of the novel. Here then, is the interactive map of <em>Paris, musée du XXIe siècle, le dixième  arrondissement</em>. Play with it, select the subjective markers you wish to see mapped to see how they appear on the  map. What is their spread throughout the arrondissement? Does a particular subjective marker occur often in proximity to a particular city feature such as  intersections or narrow streets? How does Clerc&rsquo;s topography compare with the more generally known topography of the Tenth Arrondissement? Manipulate the map using the Subjective Marker checklist or the Sequential Tour, or select different markers in the Naked City map to reveal the shifting psychogeographies of Clerc&rsquo;s audacious novel.</p>
